###A school project for React learning. 

I received only the specification and two URLs of API endpoints to call. I built this project from scratch. First I made everything with class-based components and later refactored them to use only functional components instead. I used Axios for api calls and I made a custom hook that made the requests and returned the fetched data. I used Styled Components for styling.
